# What is tidymodels?
Tidymodels is a collection of R packages and a framework for modeling and machine learning that follows the principles of tidy data and integrates seamlessly with the tidyverse ecosystem. It was developed to provide a consistent and organized way to perform machine learning tasks in R, making it easier for data scientists and analysts to build, evaluate, and deploy predictive models.

Install tidymodels with:
```{r, include = T}
# install.packages("tidymodels")
library(tidymodels)
```

# Why tidymodels and not other R package?
Tidymodels offers several advantages that may make it a suitable choice for many data scientists and analysts. Here are some reasons why Tidymodels is often preferred:

* Tidyverse Integration: Tidymodels is built on the principles of the tidyverse, which promotes consistent and user-friendly data manipulation. If you are already familiar with the tidyverse, using Tidymodels can provide a seamless and consistent experience throughout your data analysis and modeling workflow.
* Consistency and Workflow: Tidymodels provides a structured workflow for modeling, including data pre-processing, model specification, tuning, and evaluation. This consistency can make your modeling process more organized and transparent.
* Recipes for Data Pre-processing: Tidymodels includes the recipes package, which allows you to specify data pre-processing steps in a structured and reproducible manner. This is particularly helpful for feature engineering and data transformation.
* Model Agnosticism: Tidymodels is model-agnostic, meaning it allows you to work with various modeling algorithms without significant changes to your code. You can easily swap out different models for experimentation and model selection.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Tidymodels offers tools for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, making it easier to find the best combination of hyperparameters for your models.
* Resampling and Cross-Validation: The framework provides resampling methods for assessing model performance, such as cross-validation and bootstrapping, which are critical for estimating model generalization.
* Extensive Metrics: Tidymodels includes the yardstick package with a wide range of evaluation metrics for various types of models, making it easier to compare and assess model performance.
* Consistent API: The parsnip package provides a consistent interface for specifying and fitting models, regardless of the underlying modeling package. This can simplify the process of trying different models.
* Reproducibility and Documentation: Tidymodels emphasizes good practices for reproducibility, making it easier to document and share your modeling workflows with colleagues.
* Active Development: Tidymodels is actively maintained and updated, ensuring that it stays relevant and up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of machine learning.

# How does modeling fit into the data analysis process? 
According to Wickham and Grolemund (2016) the following figure illustrates the general data analysis process. Data ingestion and cleaning/tidying are shown as the initial steps. When the analytical steps for understanding commence, they are a heuristic process; we cannot pre-determine how long they may take. The cycle of transformation, modeling, and visualization often requires multiple iterations.

```
